Proliferated adoption of IoT has given rise to the fog and edge computing paradigms. As opposed to cloud computing, both fog and edge computing allow computation on data taking place closer to end users, thus improving data privacy and application performance. Nevertheless, the cloud will always exist to provide the last resort for computationally heavy tasks. The aim of this workshop is to capture and present research from a wide range of emerging topics related to modelling, designing and analysing of integrated cloud, fog, and edge computing paradigms. These have different ownership and operating objectives, preventing delivery of seamless network services across network/operator boundaries that is needed to support efficient pervasive and ubiquitous computing. For instance, it is difficult, if not impossible, to run operator A's content caching, data analytics and/or packet inspection services in operator B's cloud/fog/edge networks.  Conventional techniques for cloud do not work well in such an emerging integrated environments since they make assumptions about unified networks and systems with highly reliable and low latency connectivity.

<p class="text-justify">This workshop aims to bring together practitioners and theoreticians characterise such cloud, fog, and edge integrated systems, and to explore theoretical underpinning necessary for modelling, designing, analysing and optimising of networks and systems that have heterogeneous connectivity (e.g., intermittent and highly reliable), owned by different owners and operators, for supporting pervasive and ubiquitous computing. Since there is no single organisation can control all of the devices across all networks, we anticipate that there will be strong need for addressing the gap on policy enforcement, billing and access to data, etc. Security and privacy issues will also need tackling due to the need for business secrecy.</p>

Prof. Scheideler received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Paderborn University, Germany, in 1993 and 1996. After being a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute, Israel, for a year, a postdoc at Paderborn for two more years, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, USA, for five years, and an associate professor at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, for four years, he is now a full professor at the Dept. of Computer Science, Paderborn University, and has served as the department chair from 2013 to 2017. He is (co)author of more than 100 publications in refereed conferences and journals and has served on more than 50 conference committees. His main research focus is on distributed algorithms and data structures (in particular, for peer-to-peer systems, wireless networks, and programmable matter), and the design of algorithms and architectures for robust and secure distributed systems. Among his various professional activities, he is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of the ACM and the Journal of Computer and System Sciences, and he is the general chair of the ACM SPAA conference since 2015.</p>

				<ul><li> Abstract: In my presentation I will propose a new link-layer model for dis- tributed computing based on so-called relays that promises to be useful for the design of robust and secure distributed systems based on overlay networks and, in particular, for fog computing.</li></ul>

                <p> <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204" target="_blank">Dr Eiko Yoneki</a>. Dr Yoneki is a senior researcher leading a group on ‘Data Centric Systems’ in the Systems Research Group of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. She is also a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute in London. Eiko has received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. Prior to academia, she worked for IBM in US, Japan, Italy and UK, where she received the highest Technical Award. Her research interests span distributed systems, networking and databases, including large-scale graph processing. Her current research focusses on auto-tuning of data processing/analytics framework to deal with complex parameter space using machine learning approaches for efficient parallel processing on scheduling and load balancing. She also works on several projects with African and South American countries, including ‘digital epidemiology’, understanding of human interactions in rural societies by applying wireless/sensing technology, and advanced modelling of infectious disease spread. She also works on supporting farmers by early detection of crop bugs or diseases by applying sensing and image analysis with machine learning.
                <ul><li><strong> Keynote: Digital Epidemiology and Beyond </strong></li></ul>
				<ul><li>Respiratory and other close-contact infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), measles and pneumonia, are major killers in much of the developing world. Mathematical models are essential for understanding how these diseases spread, and for understanding how best to control them. Although central to modelling, few quantitative real-world data on relevant contact patterns are available. Capturing human interactions provides an empirical, quantitative measurement of social interaction patterns to inform mathematical models of the spread of close-contact diseases. We have developed various systems to collect human contact/mobility data. The recent emergence of wireless technology (e.g. mobile phones and sensors) makes it possible to collect real-world data on human proximity.</li></ul>
